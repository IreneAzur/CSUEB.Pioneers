                  <p> Hello and Welcome to my Site, Im Irene but you can call me Ai. </p>
                  <p> I Graduated and received my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at California State University, East Bay in Hayward, CA on May 2021. </p>
                  <p> I am one of many students who've had to study at home/Online when Coronavirus first hits America last year, It was very challenging and also depressing time. </p>
                  <p> I didn't give up though and although i was financially, emotionally, and mentally unstable at that time, I never gave up. </p>
                  <p> I cried a lot of times, each time i failed a test and I happy when i passed tests. And that's ok. </p>
                  <p> I always pray to God that I know after all these hardships he was giving me, I know one day, It will be all worth it. </p>
                  <p> And it is, Now i have Bachelor's Degree and I am proud to say that I am a Pioneer Alumni! </p>
