                  <p> Hello and Welcome to my Page. </p>
                  <p> I Graduated and received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at California State University, East Bay in Hayward, CA on May 2021. </p>
                  <p> I am one of many students who had to study at home/Online when Coronavirus hits America last year, It was very challenging and also depressing time. </p>
                  <p> I didn't give up though and although i was financially, emotionally, and mentally unstable at that time, I never give up. </p>
                  <p> I cried a lot of times, each time i fail a test. </p>
                  <p> And I always pray to God that I know after all these hardships he is giving me, I know one day, It will be all worth it. </p>
                  <p> And it is, Now i have Bachelor's degree and I am proud to say that I am a Pioneer Alumni! </p>
